What ProjectPals Does?

ProjectPals is a platform designed to connect project creators with potential collaborators. It features a "Hire" option for users to post job openings when seeking project collaborators and an "Open to Work" status for users looking for opportunities to participate in projects.

Why ProjectPals is Useful?

ProjectPals serves as a field of opportunities for both project makers who need team players with specific expertise and individuals seeking projects to enhance their skills. For instance, it can help an app development project find a UI/UX designer or a book writer find a co-author.

How Users Can Get Started with ProjectPals?

Users can start by creating a profile on ProjectPals, indicating their skills and expertise. They can then browse through available projects under the "Hire" section or mark their status as "Open to Work" to signal their availability for new opportunities.

Who Contributes to ProjectPals?

ProjectPals was created to fulfill the final project requirements of the Sistem Basis Data subject during our second year. The contributors to this project are Azriel Dimas, Fathia Alfajr, and Nicholas Samosir. Additionally, users contribute to the platform by providing feedback and suggestions, helping to improve and evolve the service.
